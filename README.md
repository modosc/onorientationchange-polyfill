# onorientationchange-polyfill [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/onorientationchange-polyfill.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/onorientationchange-polyfill)

Client polyfill to handle the `window.onorientationchange` calls that [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) on iOS makes when the hardware orientation is changed. This doesn't enable you to do anything with this event (if you cared that much you'd already have a handler defined), it just makes the errors go away.
